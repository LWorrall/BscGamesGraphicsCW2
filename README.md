**Overview**

This repo holds code for a C++ program which renders a 3D scene when run. The program uses vertex and gramgnet shaders coded in GLSL ro render a scene using OpenGL.
The scene consists of a plane with five barrels positioned ontop. Both the barrels and plane are textured using .png image files.
The scene includes a moving light source that casts it's light around the floor and barrel's surfaces as it moves.
A multi-texturing effect is applied to the barrel to display two overlapping textures.

As well as these techniques, this program uses physically based rendering (PBR) as its main shading model.
Each object in the scene has different parameters that can be set to adjust how the lighting behaves with the object. 
These parameters are an objects colour, reflectance, and whether or not an object s metallic or dielectric.

PBR shading simulates physics theory and models in order to generate a method of graphics shading that can be regarded as more accurate than other shading methods.
This is different from other methods such as the Blinn-Phong method, where light is calculated with parameters and methods which are not based in the established physics of how light behaves in the real world.
The PBR shading in the program makes use of the microfacet model. This model is based on the theory that at a microscopic level, all surfaces have reflective properties equal to that of a mirror.
The rougher a surface is however, the more of the light gets reflected off at obscure angles, meaning the surface loses its perfectly reflective quality.
Within this shader, three different parameters can be set: A materialâ€™s roughness, colour, and whether it is metal or dielectric.
All three properties change how the final image of the shading looks.
